Streets know my name, they whisper it in the dark
Rising from nothing, I've been grinding from the start
${prompt} is more than words, it's a lifestyle I'm living
Taking no prisoners, only lessons I'm giving

CHORUS:
On top of the world, can't nobody bring me down
From the bottom to the pinnacle, I'm wearing the crown
${prompt} in my veins, ambition in my heart
This is just the beginning, this is just the start

VERSE 2:
Doubters turned to believers, haters into fans
Built this empire with these two working hands
${prompt} taught me patience, showed me how to persist
The journey's been long but the rewards can't be missed

CHORUS:
On top of the world, can't nobody bring me down
From the bottom to the pinnacle, I'm wearing the crown
${prompt} in my veins, ambition in my heart
This is just the beginning, this is just the start

BRIDGE:
They never saw me coming
Never thought I'd make it this far
But I'm still running
Reaching for the stars

OUTRO:
This is my time, my moment to shine
${prompt} made me who I am
And I'm claiming what's mine`;

Memories of you still linger in the air
I reach out for your touch but you're no longer there
${prompt} was our promise, now broken in two
These empty nights remind me of the love we once knew

CHORUS:
In the shadows of what we had
${prompt} haunts me, leaves me feeling sad
Lost in the echo of your goodbye
Wondering how our love could die

VERSE 2:
The rain against my window plays our melody
A symphony of tears that won't set me free
${prompt} was our shelter from the storm
Now I'm drenched in pain, trying to keep warm

CHORUS:
In the shadows of what we had
${prompt} haunts me, leaves me feeling sad
Lost in the echo of your goodbye
Wondering how our love could die

BRIDGE:
I'd give anything to turn back time
To feel your heart beating next to mine
One more chance to make things right
One more chance to hold you tight

OUTRO:
But some things can't be fixed
Some wounds never heal
${prompt} was our beautiful mistake
A broken dream that feels too real`;

    // Default lyrics for other combinations
    return `VERSE 1:
Walking through this journey called life
Navigating through the joy and the strife
${prompt} colors every step that I take
Every decision, every path that I make

CHORUS:
${prompt} lifts me higher than before
Opens windows when I can't find the door
This feeling inside can't be denied
It's the rhythm of my heart, my inner guide

VERSE 2:
Some days are sunshine, others are rain
But through it all, I've learned to remain
Steady in the face of whatever comes my way
${prompt} gives me strength for another day

CHORUS:
${prompt} lifts me higher than before
Opens windows when I can't find the door
This feeling inside can't be denied
It's the rhythm of my heart, my inner guide

BRIDGE:
When darkness falls and I lose my way
When doubt creeps in and tries to stay
I remember the power of ${prompt}
And find my courage to begin anew

OUTRO:
This is my story, this is my song
With ${prompt} beside me, I'll always be strong`;
